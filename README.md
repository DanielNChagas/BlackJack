# BlackJack
Implementation of blackjack using Object Oriented Programming. Besides the implementation of the game, 3 counting strategies (Basic, Hi-lo and Ace-five) were also implemented. This project has 3 different modes: 

- Interactive Mode - where the player is playing with the dealer through commands in the command line;
- Debug Mode - where the game is fully loaded from a file;
- Simulation Mode - where the game is automatically played with a card counting strategy to understand the average gain in the balance of the player.

Also, while playing the interactive mode, the player can ask for advice using the counting strategies.
